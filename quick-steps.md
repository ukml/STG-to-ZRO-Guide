# Quick DIY Migration Steps (5 Mins + Gas Time)

**Warning**: Use official links only. Start with $10-50 test amount. Not advice—DYOR.

1. **Withdraw STG from Coinbase**:
   - App/Site: Assets > STG > Send > Wallet address (e.g., MetaMask on Ethereum).
   - Fee: ~$5-20. Confirm network (ETH mainnet).

2. **Set Up Wallet** (If New):
   - Download MetaMask (free app/extension).
   - Add ETH network; fund with $50+ gas (buy via Coinbase).

3. **Swap on Portal**:
   - Go: [stargate.finance](https://stargate.finance/) (bookmark it!).
   - Connect wallet > Select STG > Enter amount > Swap to ZRO.
   - Approve (once) + Confirm. Gas: $10-50 (cheaper on Base if supported).

4. **Deposit ZRO Back?**:
   - Coinbase: Assets > ZRO > Receive > Send from wallet.

Done! Track ZRO on [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network). If stuck: [Coinbase Help](https://help.coinbase.com/en).

Pro Tip: Use Base chain for lower fees if the portal allows.
