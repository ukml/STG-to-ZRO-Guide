# STG to ZRO Migration Guide: What Coinbase Users Need to Know

Hey everyone! 👋 I'm a crypto beginner documenting the Stargate Finance (STG) migration to LayerZero (ZRO) in real-time (as of Dec 2025). This happened back in August, but with Coinbase's recent announcement, it's heating up again. If you're holding STG on Coinbase and wondering "What now?", this repo has you covered.

## Quick Facts
- **What Happened?** LayerZero acquired Stargate for ~$110M, swapping all STG tokens for ZRO at **1 STG = 0.08634 ZRO**. STG is now retired—no more staking or governance. [](grok_render_citation_card_json={"cardIds":["02ce5e","4accb7"]})
- **Coinbase's Stance**: They **won't auto-migrate** your STG. You handle it yourself via a wallet. [](grok_render_citation_card_json={"cardIds":["807c4f"]}) (Thread: [Coinbase X Post](https://x.com/CoinbaseMarkets/status/1998499150711718109))
- **Why Care?** Unmigrated STG could lose value fast. ZRO might moon with Stargate's revenue flowing in (50% buybacks!).
