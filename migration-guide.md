# Deep Dive: Why Coinbase Won't Migrate STG & What It Means for You

## The Migration Basics
Stargate's cross-chain bridge tech got scooped up by LayerZero in Aug 2025. All STG holders can swap to ZRO via [stargate.finance](https://stargate.finance/)—no deadline yet. It's a fixed rate, but STG utility ends soon (no rewards, fading liquidity).

## Why Won't Coinbase Do It?
Coinbase prioritizes security and simplicity:
- **Risks Involved**: Migrations use third-party smart contracts—hacks or bugs could hit millions of users.
- **Their Policy**: They auto-migrate simple ones (e.g., some ERC-20 upgrades) but skip complex DeFi events to avoid liability. Recent example: They handled Celo but not ASI merger.
- **Empower Users**: Push for self-custody—aligns with crypto's "not your keys, not your coins" vibe.

From Coinbase's Dec 9 thread: "Coinbase will not execute the migration... use a compatible self-custodial wallet."

## Effects on Users (The Real Talk)
Holding STG on Coinbase? It's still tradable for now, but here's the breakdown:

| Impact | What Happens | What to Do |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Value & Utility** | STG price may tank as liquidity dries up. ZRO gets Stargate fees (50% buybacks—bullish!). | Swap ASAP if you believe in LayerZero. Track via [Coinbase Converter](https://www.coinbase.com/converter/stg/zro). |
| **Trading/Withdrawals** | STG pairs (e.g., STG-USDC) active. Withdraw to wallet for swap. ZRO is listed. | Withdraw STG (~$5-20 fee). Gas for swap: $10-50 on ETH/Base. |
| **Migration Process** | Manual: Wallet → Portal → Approve/Swap. No KYC. | See [Quick Steps](quick-steps.md). Test small! Risks: Phishing, failed txns. |
| **Stakers** | veSTG unlocks auto; get revenue share snapshot. | Claim via LayerZero updates—no rush. |
| **Taxes** | Swap = taxable event (capital gains). Coinbase won't report it. | Log your basis; use tools like Koinly. US/UK: Report on tax forms. |
| **Risks** | Delay = opportunity loss. Delist risk = fire sale. Self-custody = hack potential. | Enable 2FA, hardware wallet. Sell STG for stables if unsure. |

Bottom line: Coinbase's "nope" means more work, but it's a chance to level up your DeFi skills. Questions? Open an issue!
